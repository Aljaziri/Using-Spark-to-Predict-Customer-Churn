# Using Spark to Predict Customer Churn

This project is towards my Udacity Data Science nanodegree's cap stone project. 

## Overview
Understanding customer churn (cancellation) of a service and identifying users who might churn are key business problems across many industries. This requires analyzing the data but in some industries this means dealing with big amount of data. Think about streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music â€¦  etc)  Every interaction with the service from millions of users around the world led to generating data records. Imagine the challenge to store and analyze such big data. Apache Spark is analytics engine that was built for such challenging large-scale data processing.
 In my capstone project I am trying to analyze customer churn for a hypothetical music streaming service called Sparkify. As decision-makers at these music streaming service provider, we would like to understand the contributing factors of such churning behaviors that will serve as the primary objective of this subject project.
